Vision Statement

For those who are interested in D&D and whom want to have a more accessible and streamlined experience, the Debug Entities website is both a tool kit and game running aid that will provide bookkeeping assistance as well as multiple visuals for facilitating interactions of the user and the often-complex aspects of the game. It will also contain visuals for the characters and items. Unlike other D&D simulators and games , our Debug Entities website will have a rich search functionality so users can search through the many books in the database and find data from only what they need instead of wasting time going through hundreds of pages of hard-covered books manually.
