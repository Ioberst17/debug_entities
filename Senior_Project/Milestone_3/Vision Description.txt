Vision DescriptionTeam Debug Entities wanted to create this project that is about DND that would create a tool kit. We started to brainstorm and discussed what we wanted this project to be about, what would it have, what would change from other people who already make these types of programs. I understand that this is not an original project since there is a lot of DNDÕs, but this team decided to make it different from other DNDÕs that way we had something to show that we listen to other players and how current players would want their features to be. This tool kit vision is that we create very define rules to make it easier for players to know what they need to do for this DND. It would have visuals for scenes, preloaded modules visuals for characters and items and content. This is a way for players to have visuals and content to make their experience of playing more pleasant and it would catch their attention. This would also have a search function, searchable and filterable monster lists, player sheets, bookkeeping, capability of having many books to have everything access to them so they can play the game more frequently than losing time finding information inside books, and this way it would give them a faster access to their information about the game. We also thought it would be similar to a game named Mansions of madness, but we would use this game as a templet to know what a really nice outcome could look like and also add our own design as well. This is what we vision our project would have and look when everything is done and ready to present.
