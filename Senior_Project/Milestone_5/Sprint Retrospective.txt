Sprint RetrospectiveWhat went well?* We all were talking and that no one was silent, and we communicated very well.* We just misunderstood the things that we needed to do but we got what we thought we need to do done.* Communication and meetings.What could’ve gone better?* Set up more independently (user stories wise to not depend on other ones before others.)* Database requirements.Recommendations for the next sprint?* Manage git better* And get things more prioritized * Miss a meeting and be really informed about what was covered and what needs to be done. Summary:We want to make sure we are more organized and get everything set up for everything to be set and ready to go. We want to be more informative and be clarified of how things went and what we need to do. Everyone agrees that there were things that went well and things that we need to work on. From having this experience of what we went  through on the class project we have learned how to really go about our user stories and that we need to make better choice of not choosing ones that depend on other user stories so we do not get behind.
